note: task not done in this day must be copied into the next day

- replace source code copyright and license header
- document c++ classes with Doxygen format
- pay attention on the communication between QML adn C++ using the RemoteServer class: rewrite the class in order to read data from http[s] in async way and make "cached" the API exposed to the QML to minimize the return time. Actual implementation could freeze all controls if http request is served with a long delay (>300ms)
	- C++ Variables Management Class creation
	- Polling thread implementation (updating vars from emoncms)
	- Init variable loading
	- Sync vars management class with QML/Timer
- Info page improvement with relative controls position
- Settings page creation with API Key input (at the moment a virtual keyboard won't be implemented) + user input parameters
- QML Timer & C++ Functions code implementation
- Sending a GET request to upload data online from a qml text field and returning the input text by decoding json response
- connect signal in C++ class to "slot" on QML control
